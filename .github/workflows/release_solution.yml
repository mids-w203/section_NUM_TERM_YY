# Schedule the action
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  # The actions are scheduled by the following crontab. **All times are based in UTC**. The first two entries are minutes and hours (in UTC), and 
  # the last entry is the day (0: Sunday, 1: Monday,..., 6: Saturday). 
  # Example: 
  #   Suppose that I want to release the homeworks every Wednesday at 7:30pm PST, i.e., Thursday at 2:30am UTC.
  #   In the crontab, I would use '30 2 * * 4'. 
  #   For more, go to https://crontab.guru/#30_2_*_*_4
